# MLB_Impact_games_vs_Playoff_Performance

There are 162 games for each team in the regular season. Each team plays the same number of games, but there are no two schedules exactly 
alike. I have a theory that you can tell how good a team is by seeing how well they perform against the best. For this project, I wanted to
isolate how well a team performs in what I call 'impact games' vs how well they perform in the post season. I define impact games as: 

- a regular season game where both teams end up making the playoffs in that same season and at least one starting pitcher makes a 
postseason start in that year.
- Impact game for team A if: starting pitcher for Team B makes at least one start in the playoffs in that same season.
- Impact game for team B if: starting pitcher for Team A makes at least one start in the playoffs in that same season.
- Impact game for both A and B if: both starting pitchers make at least one start in the playoffs in that same season.

This project explores any correlation between winning percentage in impact games and winning percentage in the playoffs for the 2000-2018 
season.
